This project aims to test skills in html and css, specifically grid. At the end of this project I will have demonstrated proficency in the aforementioned skills by building an admin dashboard.

Having now completed the project, a aspect that stood out to me is how useful grid is in formatting a page. Not only is it useful by itself, when combined with something like flexbox positioning can become much easier.
